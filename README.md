# monkey
This repository is my walkthrough of constructing an interpreter and
compiler for the Monkey language as outlined in _Writing an Interpreter in Go_
and the sequel _Writing a Compiler in Go_ by Thorsten Ball. As the name may
indicate, this implementation will be in Go, but there may be additions in
other languages in the future.
